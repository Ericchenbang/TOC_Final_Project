      "content": "The Himalayas and Kathmandu may lure all the tourists, but Nepal's Terai lowlands are teeming with wildlife, national parks and an innovative homestay network.\n\"We'll barbecue the rat in a moment,\" said Shyam Chaudhary. \"But first, I'll show you how to make spicy fruit pickle.\" Dressed in a scarlet sari fringed with colourful pompoms, Chaudhary set me to work in her kitchen. Together we chopped onions, chillies and starfruit, before tossing them into a searing wok with sugar, coriander and cumin, and frying the mixture for 20 minutes.\nWe were preparing a variety of foods for a special festival later that day – one I'd been invited to attend while lodging at Chaudhary's home in Bhada, a remote village in Nepal's southern Terai region near the border with India. Terai is also the homeland of the indigenous Tharu people.\nA world away from the crowded trails of the Himalayas and the tourist hubs of the Kathmandu Valley, the Terai's lowland plains showcase a very different side to Nepal: wildlife-rich national parks, sweeping farmlands, and one of the world's most important pilgrimage sites: Lumbini , the sacred birthplace of the Buddha.\nI'd arranged my stay through the Community Homestay Network , a nationwide initiative that helps travellers experience a more authentic, off-the-beaten-track side of Nepal, with the added benefit of putting money in the pockets of local families.\nAfter a few enjoyable hours in Chaudhary's simple adobe kitchen – built from timber, mud, paddy stalks and goat hair – the rhythmic beating of madal (buffalo-skin drums) began rising from the surrounding fields. It was the cue to carry our trays of home-cooked dishes outside, where local farmers were erecting a towering bamboo cane strung with marigold garlands – the Tharu version of a scarecrow.\nA crowd gathered around it, and soon a boisterous party was in full swing. The day-long festivities, called Auli , mark the end of the rice harvest, giving thanks to Mother Nature for her bounty. Eating of a sacrificed rice-field rat, fresh from the kitchen barbecue, is central to the ritual – a symbolic plea to the gods to keep pests from ravaging the seedlings, plants and grains of the coming year's crop.\nI was pulled into the throng to dance and sing, while my makeshift drinking cup – crafted from tree leaves stitched together with shards of bamboo – was constantly refilled with chhyang , the local firewater: one version distilled from rice; the other, sweeter and more mushroomy, made from the dried blossoms of the butter tree.\nIt was a privilege to take part in such a sacred event, and to be welcomed so warmly by the Guruwa (an animist high priest who serves as a conduit between the village and the spirit world), alongside families from the 10 other homestays in Bhada – all of which are run by local women.\nOver sticky rice and shredded, roasted rat – the gamey flavour thankfully tempered by a garnish made with generous amounts of garlic and chilli – the women told me how their homestays have helped put Bhada on the map, bringing in both Nepalese visitors and a first trickle of foreigners.\n\"People can see our traditional way of life, and we get to welcome guests we'd never normally meet and show them Tharu hospitality,\" said Hariram Chaudhary, who runs one of the homestays. \"We have a saying: Atithi devo bhava, meaning 'the guest is god'. It's how we like people to feel.\"\nHariram added that employment opportunities are limited for women in rural Nepal but they all now have their own bank accounts, and homestay revenues have given them newfound financial independence. \"Running a business has been life-changing,\" she said. \"Now we have an income and, for the first time, a voice in our communities.\"\nThe Tharu's culture, which has changed little over the centuries, is a major draw of the Terai; the other is the rich wildlife that inhabits a narrow strip of grasslands, wetlands and subtropical forests protected in reserves and national parks. The most notable are Shukla Phanta , home to vast herds of spotted deer and the world's largest population of barasingha (swamp deer); Bardiya , famed for its Bengal tigers; and Chitwan , home to growing numbers of tigers, wild Asian elephants and greater one-horned rhinos.\nChitwan National Park, a Unesco World Heritage Site, receives hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, most of whom stay in Sauraha, a touristy town where backpackers in harem pants stroll the dusty streets and pizza joints pump out Western pop music. But the community-managed forests surrounding the park are just as rich in flora and fauna and see only a fraction of the visitors. To escape the crowds, I travelled next to the village of Barauli , the gateway to a corridor of four community forests: Shanti Kunj, Namuna, Krishna Sar and Gundrahi Daha.\nBarauli has 12 homestays clustered around a small central square, with guests assigned on a rotating basis to ensure a fair spread of business between families. I was hosted by Janaki Mahato, who greeted me wearing traditional Tharu clothing. \"Visitors show great interest in our culture, which has given me a renewed pride in who I am,\" she said, placing a marigold garland around my neck. \"So, I love to put on my nahagi (white sari) and ornaments for when they arrive.\"\nPlan your trip\nTravellers can reserve individual homestays and activities directly with Community Homestay Network or multi-day \"Circuits\" with local, English-speaking guides (ground transportation and accommodation included). Their nine-day Terai tour includes Bhada and Barauli. Wildlife can be seen year-round outside the monsoon months of Jun-Sept, with peak viewing in Feb-Apr.\nMahato showed me to my simply decorated room, complete with Western-style bathroom and air conditioning. When I asked, she explained that, like all members of the homestay network, she receives 80% of the fee ( £50/ $66 full board per night), with the remainder going into a community fund. \"In Barauli, it's been used to pay for an English teacher at the local school; this will help all our children lead better lives,\" she said. The community benefits in other ways too: villagers earn extra income by supplying produce for guests' meals or offering activities such as henna art classes and guided mountain bike rides.\nI opted for a half-day 4x4 safari, and the next morning, after a breakfast of chilli-spiced omelette and dhikri (steamed rice flour cakes) in the dining room, I set off with farmer-turned- nature guide Sumit Chaudhary.\nWhile dozens of 4x4s regularly enter Chitwan, Sumit told me ours would be one of only two entering the community forests that day. Wildlife crosses from the national park into these forests daily, he explained, despite the natural barrier of the Narayani River.\nWithin minutes, we saw troops of macaques and langur monkeys scattering through the tree branches. Then, the warning cry of a spotted deer alerted its herd – and us – to the presence of one of the region's star attractions: a Bengal tiger. We later crossed paths with wild boars, barasinghas, junglefowl, peacocks, hornbills and storks.\nThe highlight, though, was seven exhilarating sightings of one-horned rhinos – including a mother and calf leisurely grazing in a pond filled with water hyacinths, and a sturdy five-year-old male who came so close to our vehicle, we could hear the gentle huffs and puffs of his breath.\nAs the Sun began to set, we drove back to Barauli through a string of rural settlements where traditional Tharu life was on full display: locals winnowing rice, milking water buffaloes, trimming white radishes for market and playing games of carrom – a cross between billiards and table shuffleboard.\n\"Community tourism has had a positive impact here,\" Sumit said, as we exchanged friendly waves with villagers. \"One major change is how people view wildlife.\" He explained that animals were once mostly seen as crop-destroying nuisances; and although some human-wildlife conflict still exists, the animals are now recognised as valuable assets worth protecting.\n\"It's a model of how tourism should be,\" he added. \"Be kind to nature and it will flourish. That will attract tourists. If they visit in a way that's respectful to both the local people and the environment, then everyone benefits.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram ."

      "link": "https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20251208-the-anti-materialist-christmas-rituals-around-the-world-that-swap-gifts-for-meaning",
      "content": "These seven global traditions show a different side to the season; one that's more communal, more reflective and far less materialistic.\nIf you're feeling like the real meaning of Christmas got buried under mountains of wrapping paper, looking at how other countries celebrate can be surprisingly grounding. Traditions vary dramatically from place to place, shaped by landscape, history, values and climate. While many nations do exchange gifts, the rituals around them differ enormously. These long-loved customs show us that Christmas doesn't need to be transactional; it can be collaborative, creative or community-driven, from singing in candlelit churches to quietly honouring family – or even appreciating spiders.\nFrom remembering departed loved ones to leaning into a multi-generational game, here are seven Christmas traditions you can adopt wherever you are.\nIn Iceland, publishers release a flurry of new releases in the run-up to Christmas – a seasonal phenomenon known as the jólabókaflóð , or \"Christmas book flood\". The tradition dates back to World War Two, when most goods were rationed except paper, making books the most practical Christmas gift. Today, it helps support the niche Icelandic publishing industry; strengthens a love of the Icelandic language, which is at risk of dying out; and delights booklovers nationwide.\nOn 24 December, families exchange presents, eat Christmas dinner and then spend the evening reading their new books by candlelight, perhaps with a box of chocolates and a drink beside them. It's a ritual that feels distinctly Icelandic, but one of the easiest to replicate anywhere.\nAs a largely non-Christian country, Japan celebrates Christmas in its own distinct way. Instead of a family-centred celebration, Christmas Eve plays out more like Valentine's Day – a romantic evening for couples. The wintery streets glow with Christmas lights, restaurants offer special menus and luxury hotels often book out.\nChristmas food is quite different too: Japanese people celebrate by eating kurisumasu keki , a light layered sponge with cream and perfectly cut strawberries. To borrow the spirit of the tradition: carve out a little dedicated time for your partner amid the usual family chaos.\nChristmas Day in Australia centres on sunshine, food and family. It's also a time to grab a tinny (a can of beer), a bat and some stumps, and indulge in a great Australian family tradition: the Christmas cricket match. Everyone is invited and all ages are welcome.\nFor one day only, cricket isn't about winning, it's about everyone taking part. If your five-year-old nephew is caught at slip on his first try, someone will likely turn a blind eye and let him bat again. Rules vary from household to household, with some more ruthless than others.\nFor those in colder climates, hope for better weather or break out a board game instead.\nHonouring deceased relatives is central to the Finnish Christmas. On Christmas Eve, families visit cemeteries to light candles for loved ones who have passed away. According to This Is Finland , three-quarters of Finnish households take part, transforming graveyards into serene landscapes of snow and flickering candlelight.\nMore like this:\n• Why no one does Christmas better than the Finns\n• Seven countries, one winner: The best Christmas market in Europe\n• A nostalgic French drink that evokes Christmas\nCemeteries can be crowded at this time, but it's still seen as a rare moment of peace and reflection during a hectic season. Cemetery visits are often followed by another cherished Finnish tradition: the Christmas Eve family sauna.\nIn Western Ukraine, the most typical Christmas decoration isn't a bauble or a star but a bejewelled spiderweb. The custom stems from The Legend of the Christmas Spider, an Eastern European folktale in which a spider decorates the Christmas tree of a woman too poor to afford ornaments. She wakes in the morning to find it glittering with silvery webs, and from that day forward, her family is never in need again.\nUkrainians craft delicate webs from paper and wire and wrap them around their tree like tinsel. Finding a real spider or cobweb on a tree is considered to be good luck, and it's customary to not sweep them away during this period. The easiest way to adopt the tradition: leave the cobwebs undisturbed.\nA klippe klistre day – literally \"cutting and sticking\" – is an essential Danish ritual. Homes, schools and workplaces across the country hold crafting sessions to make elaborate garlands, braided stars and paper hearts to bring Christmas cheer to classrooms, offices and living rooms.\nIt's a chance to hygge together and build a sense of community through creativity, all fuelled by æbleskiver (small Christmas doughnuts), cookies and gløgg , Denmark's potent mulled wine. After years of practice, Danes seem able to turn the thinnest twist of paper into something quite magical – but even a simple paper garland can being a touch of Scandinavian craftiness to your home.\nChristmas church services in Venezuela are joyful, communal and often lively, accompanied by bells, firecrackers and sometimes fireworks in the run-up to Christmas. But the most distinctive custom is how people often arrive: on roller skates.\nThe tradition centres on skating to the early-morning Misa de Aguinaldo (Early Morning Mass) held between 16 and 24 December around 05:00 or 06:00. Children often go to bed early so they're ready for the dawn service, and many adults skate through the night to reach the church together. It's a beloved ritual that turns a solemn moment into something light-hearted and communal, with neighbours gliding through quiet streets side-by-side.\nIf skating isn't an option, joining a local mass or community event can bring a similar sense of shared celebration.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram ."

      "title": "Five of the world's safest countries for 2025",
      "link": "https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250822-five-of-the-worlds-safest-countries-for-2025",
      "content": "In a year marked by conflict, five nations continue to rank among the world's most peaceful. Residents reveal how policies and culture shape daily life and create a sense of calm.\nIn 2025, peace has felt like a rare commodity. Global wars have escalated, border security has tightened and trade tensions continue to mount. According to the 2025 Global Peace Index (GPI), the number of state-based conflicts has reached its highest level since World War Two, with three more breaking out this year alone. Many countries are responding with increased militarisation.\nYet despite those grim statistics, some nations continue to prioritise peace. The GPI, produced by the Institute for Economics & Peace , tracks 23 indicators, from external conflicts and military expenditure to safety and security measures like terrorism and homicide. The countries ranked at the top of the index have been remarkably consistent for nearly two decades, showing the stability that peaceful policies can bring over the long haul.\nWe spoke to residents in some of the world's most peaceful counties to learn about how those policies shape day-to-day life – and what gives them a unique sense of security and calm.\nRanked number one since 2008, Iceland remains the world's most peaceful nation, leading across all three domains: safety and security, ongoing conflict and militarisation. It even recorded a 2% improvement this year, widening the gap from the second-place country on the list.\nFor locals, that sense of safety is baked into everyday life. \"While harsh weather conditions, especially in winter, may not always create a sense of safety, community does,\" said Inga Rós Antoníusdóttir, who was born in Iceland and is general manager for Intrepid Travel North Europe . \"You can walk alone at night mostly without worry; you will see babies sleeping peacefully in prams outside cafes and shops while their parents enjoy a meal or [are] running errands; and the local police don't carry guns.\"\nInga credits the country's world-leading gender equality policies with allowing women to feel secure. \"Equal opportunities and robust social systems create a fairer, safer society for everyone,\" she said.\nShe recommends visitors experience this inner calm by joining locals in everyday rituals. \"Go for a swim in a geothermal pool and chat with strangers in the hot tub; hike a mountain, whether it's an afternoon climbing Mt Esja right outside of Reykjavik or a multi-day hike in the highlands,\" she said. \"The real Iceland is found in its thriving music and art scene, in nature away from the main sites and in all kinds of weather.\"\nThough marked by conflict throughout the late 20th Century, today's Ireland continues to put peace at the forefront. It received especially high scores for reducing its militarisation year-over-year and ranked as one of the countries with the fewest ongoing domestic and international conflicts. It also placed within the top 10 for societal safety and security, with low perceptions of crime and violence.\nThat feeling extends throughout the country for residents. \"A deep sense of community and friendliness makes you feel welcome and at ease, whether you're in a small town or a big city,\" said Jack Fitzsimons, Kildare resident and director of experiences at Kilkea Castle . He finds that strong social support systems and a focus on community welfare also reduces inequality and tension. \"People look out for one another here,\" he added. \"It's the kind of place where you can ask a stranger for help and they'll go out of their way for you.\"\nOn the global stage, the country maintains a military neutrality (which prevents it from being an official member of Nato, one of only four European countries without membership), and a preference for using diplomacy to solve conflict. At home, the country prioritises preservation of its landscapes and cultural sites, and ensures travellers always feel welcome. \"It still amazes me how surprised guests are about how friendly Irish people are. For us, it is just part of our fabric, as we have an innate sense of hospitality to overseas visitors,\" said Fitzsimons.\nIreland's relaxed nature also leads to a sense of peace. \"You're never far from a castle, a quiet forest walk or a traditional music session in a cosy pub,\" said Fitzsimons. \"Life moves at a more relaxed pace here, and people still value conversation and storytelling. That human connection really stands out.\"\nThis year New Zealand moved up two spots to number three, thanks to improvements in the safety and security domain as well as fewer demonstrations and terrorism-related impacts.\nAs an island nation in the Pacific, New Zealand's geography gives it natural protection from external conflict, but its internal policies also afford residents a sense of peace. \"New Zealand's gun laws are among the strictest in the world, which absolutely contributes to the sense of safety,\" said lifelong Kiwi Mischa Mannix-Opie, director of client experience at relocation firm Greener Pastures . She notes that it's a place where kids walk to school, people leave their doors unlocked and motorists will stop to help if a vehicle is broken down on the side of the road. \"There's a general trust in others and in the systems around you, which creates a real sense of community in daily life.\"\nMore like this:\n• The secret to life in the world's best cities\n• The world's most liveable cities for 2025 - and what it's really like to live there\n• Why Minneapolis is one of the world's happiest places\nBeyond the strong social safety net and access to universal healthcare, New Zealanders value their connection to nature, whether it's walking on the beach, hiking in the bush or having a glass of wine under the stars, says Mannix-Opie. The sense of community also means plenty of festivals and events for all ages, with an emphasis on family-friendly environments. Though many visitors come for the scenery, it's often the feeling of safety and belonging in the community that leaves the lasting impression.\n\"Beyond the postcard landscapes, New Zealand has real depth. The people are genuine, the Māori culture is rich and ever-present and the slower rhythm of life can really shift your perspective,\" said Mannix-Opie. \"One client told me that although New Zealand is beautiful, it's our people that are our superpower.\"\nAustria slipped one place this year to fourth but still ranked high across all domains. Like Ireland, Austria adopts a constitutionally mandated policy of neutrality, preventing it from joining military alliances like Nato. This enables the country to focus its attention and resources internally.\nTop 10 countries in the 2025 Global Peace Index\n1. Iceland\n2. Ireland\n3. New Zealand\n4. Austria\n5. Switzerland\n6. Singapore\n7. Portugal\n8. Denmark\n9. Slovenia\n10. Finland\n\"Austria's decades-long policy of neutrality means the nation invests in its people instead of conflicts,\" said Armin Pfurtscheller, owner of SPA-Hotel Jagdhof . \"A strong social safety net, world-class healthcare and excellent education foster stability and trust.\" He lives in Neustift in the Stubai Valley, where he says people wander along the Ruetz River at midnight, homes are left unlocked and bicycles sit unchained outside cafes. \"Safe isn't just a statistic, it's the way life feels.\"\nPfurtscheller also notices this sense of ease among guests who come to stay in the valley. \"After a couple of days, their shoulders drop, the stress melts away, and they sleep like they did as children,\" he said. \"They start to notice the sound of the river, the way the light changes on the mountains and the simple joy of breathing deeply. That is the greatest sense of safety this place offers: the certainty that here, you are free to simply be.\"\nMaintaining its position at number six, the city-state of Singapore is the only Asian country in the top 10 (Japan and Malaysia come in at 12 and 13, respectively). It ranks especially high for safety and security, even while maintaining one of the world's highest levels of military expenditure per capita, outpaced only by North Korea and Qatar.\nThe lack of ongoing conflict and internal security lead to a strong sense of safety for most residents. \"I walk late at night and do not feel afraid. Walking home is not overwhelming or anxiety-provoking like it is in most large urban cities,\" said resident Xinrun Han. \"There is 100% comfort and mutual trust in the system, which makes an environment that is calm, caring and peaceful.\"\nWhile Singapore’s conservative stance on LGBT+ protections limits some freedoms, with same-sex marriage still prohibited, social progress is visible through events like the growing Pink Dot pride festival. Many reported feeling safer at the rally this year than in past decades as younger Singaporeans push for more widespread acceptance.\nHan recommends visitors embrace the freedoms that come with security, like strolling along the river at 02:00, grabbing a bite from a late-night street food vendor or visiting the park after dark. \"It all feels very free, whether you're a resident or just visiting.\"\n--\nThis story was originally published in August 2025 and has since been updated.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram ."

      "title": "Where are all the Canadians going?",
      "link": "https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20251211-where-are-all-the-canadians-going",
      "content": "In recent years, one in four visitors to the US has been Canadian. But with so many boycotting US holidays, here's where they're heading instead.\nIn response to US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on Canadian goods – and his suggestions that Canada should become the US's 51st state – many Canadians have embraced the nation's unofficial \"elbows up\" motto, a hockey term that implies punishing the opposition. A growing number have cancelled upcoming trips to the US, and as Canadians' boycott of US travel extends into its 12th straight month, the trend sees no signs of slowing.\nFor years, Canadians have been the biggest source of international visitors to the US, making up 28% of foreign tourists in 2024 . But that figure has dropped dramatically since January 2025. According to the US Travel Association (USTA), inbound Canadian travel to the US is down 23% year-to-date (Jan-Oct), which equates to an estimated $4bn (£3bn) loss compared to the previous year. The organisation says roughly four million fewer Canadians have visited the US so far this year.\nBut Canadians are travelling more overall. That begs the question: where are they going instead?\nMany, like travel writer and content creator Emilie Brillon, say they have decided to follow national calls – including from former prime minister Justin Trudeau – to support Canada and explore more of their own country.\n\"I used to cover road trips across both Canada and the US,\" said Brillon. \"But last March I made a conscious shift to focus solely on Canada. We even cancelled a planned family trip to the Grand Canyon in April 2025 and chose to redirect that budget into the Canadian economy instead.\"\nMore like this:\n• The Canadian mountains where heli-hiking was born\n• The stunning Canadian island you can see but not touch\n• Why some travellers are avoiding the US\nToronto-based publicist Tracy Lamourie says she used to travel to the US regularly but was blunt about her plans moving forward: \"[I'm] never crossing the border again,\" she said. \"[I] switched to Europe for travel and Zoom for meetings. [Between the] 51st state rhetoric and human rights abuses – while it never seemed safe – now it's on the no-go list.\"\nLamourie's stance reflects a broader sentiment, as many international travellers have been rethinking their US travel plans this year – a trend that the USTA estimates will cost the US $5.7bn (£4.28bn).\nAccording to Statistics Canada , the country's central statistical agency, domestic travel within Canada has surged in 2025, alongside increased Canadian travel to Mexico, Portugal, the Bahamas and Belize. The agency reports a nearly 12% rise in Canadian visitors to Mexican cities year to date. Data also shows that Canadian spending in destinations like Buenos Aires, Osaka, Copenhagen and Curacao was up more than 100% this summer compared to 2024.\nMeanwhile, US destinations that typically rely on Canadian tourism are feeling the impact. Between January and July, 30% fewer Canadians crossed the border into Vermont compared to the same period in 2024. Las Vegas has seen an 18% year-to-date decline, and places like Ft Lauderdale , Upstate New York and many other regions are experiencing similar downturns.\nAn increase in flight connectivity to Europe and the Caribbean is making it easier for Canadians to bypass the US. \"From Canada to Berlin, Ponta Delgada, Nantes and Brussels, we are strategically increasing new non-stop routes across Europe to bring convenient access to key destinations, while strengthening economic ties and supporting tourism,\" Air Canada executive vice president and chief commercial officer Mark Galardo said in a statement .\nFrom 4-20 December, the airline is also launching 13 new routes to the Caribbean, Central America and South America – a move that is likely aimed at Canadian \"snowbirds\" who previously relied on US states like Florida or California for winter sun.\nJust how long Canadians will continue to avoid travel to the US is uncertain. But Brillon believes the shift could reshape Canadian travel patterns for years to come.\n\"I think the real opportunity is encouraging Canadians to explore lesser-known regions [of our own country], for example visiting the Kootenays instead of Banff ,\" she said. \"From what I'm seeing, this doesn't feel like a short-term thing; it's starting to look like a longer-term shift in how Canadians choose to travel.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram ."

      "title": "Can we save travel's most beloved tradition?",
      "link": "https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20251210-can-we-save-travels-most-beloved-tradition",
      "content": "Digital communication and social media let us stay in instant touch when we travel, but snail-mailed postcards are still uniting travellers.\nIt was a sweltering morning on the Thai island of Koh Chang and I was sitting at a cafe, sweating over a small, rectangular piece of cardboard. My eyes had zeroed in on it, shelved on a dusty postcard rack in the corner, while walking past, juggling a plastic container of sticky rice and diced mango. I'd been searching for days for one to send to my best friend in North Carolina – our custom for more than 10 years, since her family moved away when we were in secondary school.\nI'd plucked my favourite image from the rack, a shot of the white-sand beach where I was staying, paid for the card and a stamp, scrawled a message in purple marker, then slipped it into the red postbox stationed outside on the island's main street. In less than five minutes, and for around ฿50 (£1.13), I had continued our beloved tradition; linking us across continents and time.\nMy friend and I are part of an increasingly rare breed. The instant nature of digital communication, including the ability to send a \"wish you were here\" text or upload a carousel of photos to social media, has relegated snail-mailed postcards to a bit character in the theatre of travel. Call it a sign of the times: the US Post Office is currently $15bn in debt and has lost more than $9bn in 2025 alone. First-class post, which includes letters and postcards, has declined by 50% in the last 15 years in the US and is expected to decline an additional 29% in the next decade. In 2024, Americans sent roughly 325 million stamped cards and postcards , a staggering decline from the more than 2.7 billion sent in 2000. In Denmark, the country’s state-run postal service PostNord announced earlier this year that it would end letter deliveries by the end of 2025. Citing a 90% decline in letter volumes since 2000, the country has started removing its iconic red post boxes, ending a 400-year-old legacy.\nTo many, postcard-sending has become a relic of a bygone era. But while this retro travel tradition may be endangered, it is still quietly doing what it has always done best: uniting loved ones. Calls to save postcards have been spreading across social media channels like TikTok and Instagram , where the hashtag #postcard calls up 6.5 million posts announcing swaps and tips for card decorating. It's clear that travellers, from baby boomers to millennials to Gen Z, are still using them as a way to engage with their loved ones in a more purposeful way.\nPostcards came into existence in the mid-19th Century, alongside the developing tourism industry. As an entire economy was being built around travel experiences, postcards quickly became popular as a cheap and easy way to communicate, explains Jordan Girardin, a travel and tourism historian. Early postcards featured a visual with a small space for a message on the front; the back dedicated to a stamp and address. \"Postcards were meant to promote the tourism experience,\" says Girardin, a millennial who sends postcards to family members when travelling. \"It had a lot to do with publicity, advertising a certain place with a certain reputation… having a visual effect was really, really important.\"\nIn the UK, some 75 million postcards were sent in 1871, and by 1910 the country was sending more than 800 million a year. The postcards we know today, with an image on one side and space for a message and address on the other, appeared in the early 20th Century, jump-starting what was known in the US as the \" Golden Age of Postcards \"; a craze of collecting and mailing postcards that lasted between 1907 and 1915. By 1913, Americans were sending more than 900 million a year.\nSan Francisco-area artist Ginger Slonaker, a baby boomer who came of age when postcards were still the quickest – and cheapest – means of sharing travel experiences, remembers how bars, restaurants and art galleries used to literally gave them away. When living overseas, she wrote and sent several a week to her parents and mother-in-law. \"I just wanted [them] to be a little slice of what's happening in my life,\" she explains. \"Receiving a postcard was special… because they were associated with travelling to a new place.\"\nFast-forward to the rise of the internet in the 1990s, and postcards began losing their appeal – but not for all. While Slonaker now sends more texts than postcards, she still posts a few to friends every month. After all, texting can only go so far: \"Certainly your personality doesn't come across. And how many times can you send a smiling emoji?\"\nMelissa McGibbon, a millennial travel writer and editor who has been sending postcards for 30 years, calls them the \"best souvenir. Everyone has the impression that it's gone out of style and that not a lot of people are doing it anymore. However, I think there's still a lot of us out there.\"\nMcGibbon, who has visited nearly 60 countries and almost all 50 states, has haggled for postcards in a Cairo bazaar, hunted for them near Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing and even posted them from the Galápagos Islands and Antarctica. What started out as a childhood ritual shared between her and her grandparents has ballooned; over the years, she's created a 75-person-long list of travel pen pals. \"It's a very affordable way to say, 'I'm thinking of you',\" she says. \"It kind of gives me a purpose, like a mission, to hunt for a postcard for every place that I go to.\"\nFor millennial travel writer and content creator James Barrett, postcards are \"kind of like a time capsule. [They're] the perfect gift to show that you're thinking of someone while on vacation without taking up too much space in their home.\" Barrett, who has been to all seven continents, always sends postcards to his boyfriend and family members when he travels, whether it's from far-flung destinations like Fiji and Churchill, the polar bear capital of the world, or Greece and Disneyland. He'll also occasionally send one to himself if the destination is particularly special. \"There's so much more impact to simply getting a postcard than a text message. It's arguably the most thoughtful gift someone can receive,\" he says.\nIn a time when social media is an oversaturated platter of picture-perfect snapshots and curated moments, the tangibility of putting pen to paper to share quiet moments with loved ones has never been so profound. For Sofía Korous Vázquez, a freelance creative and interpreter, this is the humble postcard's exact appeal.\n\"It offers something more intentional, communication-wise. These days, because of the immediacy of messages and the urgency culture around it, it feels less intimate,\" she says. \"There's something romantic and fun about keeping that tradition alive.\" Vázquez, who is Gen Z, first started writing postcards as a child to her baby boomer grandparents. Today, she sends them to her friends.\nShe believes her generation may not send postcards as often as millennials or baby boomers do, but they still hold appeal, as documented on social media and seen through projects like Postcrossing , a global postcard exchange programme with more than 800,000 members in 210 countries; now in its 20th year. \"An email quickly gets lost in the deluge of emails we get,\" says Postcrossing founder Paulo Magalhães. \"But a postcard? It stands out – and immediately wins the placement on the fridge door or on our desks.\"\nDespite the joys of receiving and sending postcards, today the ritual comes with challenges. McGibbon has noticed that the simple act of locating a mail-worthy postcard can be difficult. She believes that if souvenir shops prioritise selling aesthetically pleasing postcards and stamps, more travellers will become invested in the practice. \"It would be a gold mine,\" she says.\nThe lack of funding wracking the global post office system has also left travellers like Vázquez and Barrett leery of sending postcards from abroad. Barrett usually mails his postcards when he returns home to the US, or in some cases will hand-deliver them. \"I'm a bit paranoid, I'd rather just make sure that it gets to the person,\" he explains.\nMore like this:\n• Why urban sketching retreats are taking off\n• The quiet travel solution to a noisy world\n• Is it time to change how we buy travel souvenirs?\nDespite the challenges, McGibbon has sent thousands in her lifetime with no plans to stop. \"It's maybe not the smartest financial decision long-term, because the cost of stamps keeps going up, but it's an investment in relationships.\"\nWhile writing and sending postcards may no longer be the way humans most communicate while travelling, Girardin believes that they still have a future, especially among people who appreciate what they stand for: \"What people were doing in the past and what they're doing now, yes, it's different. But it's also the same: we're trying to describe a moment of discovery whilst travelling and share it with people\".\nIt would take nearly six weeks for my friend in North Carolina to receive my Thai postcard, by which point my message was a distant memory, surprising and delighting us both, like developing film from an old camera. Writing postcards reminds me to be more intentional with my time and my loved ones when I travel. And that will always beat an Instagram photo.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram ."

      "title": "Paradise on a budget: How the Maldives became (surprisingly) accessible",
      "link": "https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20251127-how-the-maldives-became-surprisingly-affordable",
      "content": "Once a destination for the ultra-rich, the Maldives is now embracing a more local, sustainable model of tourism that's changing who gets to experience paradise.\nThe air smelled faintly of watermelons and salt as our ferry pulled into the island of Thoddoo, and the soundtrack was the putter of motorbikes, not the thrum of seaplanes. Twelve years ago, when I last visited while filming an episode of BBC's The Travel Show, the Maldives was still a postcard fantasy of overwater villas, private islands and prices that kept most travellers at bay. Now, families were stepping off public boats with backpacks instead of bellboys unloading Louis Vuitton trunks. This wasn't the Maldives I remembered – and that was exactly the point.\nOver the past decade, a quiet revolution has unfolded across the atolls. Government reforms have allowed Maldivians to open guesthouses on inhabited islands, breaking a long-standing rule that once confined tourism to unpopulated resort enclaves. The result has been transformative: more than 1,200 guesthouses now operate across 90 local islands, according to the Maldives' Ministry of Tourism. Travellers can experience the country's everyday culture, and, for the first time, local families can earn directly from the industry that powers their economy.\nOn my recent visit with my three children, I wanted to see what this shift looked like in practice. Our trip took us from the home-cooked hospitality of Thoddoo, often called the \"farm island\" of the Maldives, to a mid-range resort that's redefining what sustainable luxury can mean. Together, they tell a story of a country broadening its welcome and quietly reshaping what paradise looks like.\nStepping onto Thoddoo in the North Ari Atoll felt worlds away from the manicured perfection of resort life, much of which is found near the capital, Malé, in the North Malé Atoll. The public speedboat from Malé took 90 minutes and cost far less than a typical luxe resort seaplane. On arrival, we immediately noticed that the island's pace was immediately different – no cars, just bicycles and the occasional electric buggy buzzing between palm-lined, sandy lanes. Rows of papaya trees and watermelon fields stretched inland, ringed by the Maldives' iconic turquoise seas.\nWe stayed at the island's first guesthouse, Serene Sky , owned by Ahmed Karam, former president of the Guesthouse Association of the Maldives and a leading voice in the country's fast-growing local-island tourism movement. Serene Sky was simple and spotless. The pillows weren't designer, the bathroom was modest, but the welcome was genuine, and the meals were home cooking at its best – fried reef fish caught just hours earlier, curried pumpkin from the farms nearby and the freshest watermelon juice imaginable.\nKaram told me this new wave of community-led tourism has reshaped the landscape here. \"Locals now benefit directly from tourism dollars,\" he said, \"but it's also made us more aware of how much we need to protect what we have – the island, the reefs, the wildlife. That's what people come here to see.\"\nMy children loved the island's freedom. We snorkelled on the nearby reef with locals, experiencing our first magical encounter with sea turtles. Afterwards, we relaxed on one of the island's designated \"bikini beaches\", small stretches set aside for visitors to swim and sunbathe in Western swimwear. As the Maldives is a predominantly Muslim nation, modest dress is expected elsewhere.\nPlan your trip:\nMix your stay: Split your trip between a local guesthouse and a resort to experience both culture and comfort.\nTransfers: Public speedboats to islands like Thoddoo cost $30-70 (£23-53) per person one way. Book ahead in peak season.\nPack wisely: Reef-safe sunscreen, snorkel gear and reef shoes earn their space in your bag.\nRespect local customs: Use designated bikini beaches and dress modestly in villages; alcohol is prohibited on local islands.\nChoose trusted operators: Book with dive and tour companies committed to reef-friendly practices.\nPrice guide: Guesthouses from $50-60 (£38-45) per night; mid-range resorts like Sun Siyam Olhuveli from $499+ (£380); ultra-luxury stays from $1,000+ (£760).\nWe met Andy Anis, a local farmer, who invited us to his farm and sliced open a golden-fleshed watermelon in the middle of his field for us to try, juice running down our wrists in the heat. Later, at Anis' tiny juice bar, we slurped coconut ice cream and watched the island settle into evening.\nThe second leg of our journey was a world apart: Sun Siyam Olhuveli , a family-friendly, Maldivian-owned resort in the South Malé Atoll. The welcome was warm and theatrical – drums on the jetty, cold towels, smiling staff – but what struck me was the ease. Our ever-cheerful resort representative, Raail, handled everything via WhatsApp, from snorkel gear to kids' medicine.\nWe upgraded to a two-bedroom beachfront villa and took an all-inclusive plan, a model that's often dismissed as generic, but here it felt liberating. We had the choice of more than 10 restaurants and bars spread across three islands, while activities and transfers were bundled, freeing us to focus on spending time together.\nFor families chasing reef adventures without the ultra-luxury price tag, Sun Siyam Olhuveli delivers. My children roamed the shores freely, spotting reef sharks and turtles just off the house reef, while I indulged in boat dives to explore Shark Point and Banana Reef, where manta rays glided like shadows and hawksbill turtles grazed on coral heads. Back on land, the six pools (including the Maldives' longest, at 210m) provided endless space for both play and relaxation. The resort strikes a rare balance, polished yet easy-going, with the kind of warmth that comes naturally to a Maldivian-owned property.\nResorts like this are at the forefront of the Maldives' sustainability drive. Under the Sun Siyam Cares programme , guests can join beach clean-ups, plant coral and restore lagoons. The resort's \"Recycle-Reuse\" initiative turns old linens into cleaning cloths, and single-use plastics are being phased out entirely. Even my request for a plastic bag for wet swimwear was met with a smile: \"We don't use those anymore.\"\nThe push for sustainability extends beyond individual resorts. Tourism and environmental policy now work hand in hand, with regulations aimed at cutting single-use plastics, conserving energy and protecting marine life. Under President Dr Mohamed Muizzu, the Maldives has set an ambitious target : generating 33% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2028, a vital step towards reducing the country's carbon footprint and safeguarding the fragile ecosystems that underpin its tourism industry.\nMore like this:\n• A new island of hope rising from the Indian Ocean\n• How a fictitious 'sea' became a top Maldivian tourist attraction\n• Are the world's most beautiful islands in danger?\nThoriq Ibrahim, Minister of Tourism and Environment, sums up the strategy: \"Our pristine environment is our foundational asset. We are not pursuing growth at the expense of our environment.\"\nThe Maldives is evolving, and not quietly. Guesthouses and family-run stays now offer meaningful encounters with local life, while Maldivian-owned resorts are proving that comfort and conscience can coexist. For travellers once priced out of paradise, the islands now offer something far richer than exclusivity, and that's authenticity. What was once a honeymooners' fantasy is now a destination families can return to, not just aspire to.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram ."

      "title": "The case for taking the same holiday again and again",
      "link": "https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20251204-the-surprising-joy-of-going-back-to-the-same-place",
      "content": "In an increasingly stressful world, many travellers are finding comfort in repetition: returning to the same ski towns, seaside suburbs and favourite cafes each year. Experts say the appeal goes far deeper than nostalgia.\nFor the past 15 years, photographer Jason Greene and his family have headed north from New York City to Mont Tremblant in Quebec for a winter week in the snow. \"We have a tradition that on our first day, we eat maple syrup on a stick, go ice skating, then stop at the local candy store.\" The French Canadian resort town, he says, \"holds a special place in our hearts because it's where we all learned how to ski and snowboard\".\nFor many travellers, novelty is the point: ticking off new destinations and chasing new sensations. But an increasing number, like Greene and his four kids, are doing the opposite – returning to the same spot each year. They book the same room, eat the same meals and walk the same streets to find comfort in the familiar rather than the thrill of discovery.\n\"For many people, there's a sense of safety in returning to the familiar,\" says Dr Charlotte Russell, a clinical psychologist and founder of The Travel Psychologist. \"We know what to expect, what suits us… and [we're] less likely to face unexpected challenges.\"\nThe behaviour, she adds, often appeals to people who are overwhelmed in their daily lives, which is why taking the same holiday again and again can feel so soothing.\nIt's that unrivalled sense of ease that pulled me back to Lima, Peru, this past May, exactly one year after my first visit when I was writing my travel book Street Cats & Where to Find Them . I stayed at the same hotel, ate the same sandwich at the same cafe, walked the same streets and let many of the same cats sleep on my lap – revelling in the contentment that had first surprised me there.\nSociology professor Rebecca Tiger has returned to Athens eight times, with a ninth visit scheduled this month, for similar reasons. \"I always stay in Pangrati because I love the neighbourhood's cafes [and] its cats,\" she told me. \"I now have locals with whom I keep in touch while away, and socialise with when I return.\" She appreciates the familiarity she has cultivated over time, yet doesn't get bored due to the diversity of experiences on offer.\nData reflects this nostalgia-driven shift. According to Priceline's 2026 Where to Next? report, 73% of travellers surveyed said that they are drawn back to the places and experiences that shaped them, from family beaches to amusement parks. Hilton's latest global travel report echoes the trend: 58% of travellers with children plan to revisit destinations from their own childhood, while 52% of Brazilian travellers return to the same destinations year after year.\nNostalgia and comfort are what help Greene and his family \"leave the stress of life behind and relax in our favourite spots\". It's not only their maple syrup habit that's repeated on the mountain. Their daily schedule in Mont Tremblant is replicated each year, too – \"skiing and snowboarding for three days straight, then a day off for dog sledding, a carriage ride or another wintery activity\". When life becomes challenging, it's the anticipation of their winter trip – and the joy they feel there together – that helps carry them through.\nRussell says that from a neuroscience perspective, \"the reward circuits in our brain can become less responsive as we adapt to revisiting the same place.\" Yet returning can still have wellbeing benefits, she adds, noting that it's often more relaxing to go somewhere associated with enjoyment because we're \"still distanced from the cues we associate with stress\".\nGreene says his family hasn't experienced any drop-off in excitement from doing the exact same things in the exact same order each year. Still, Tiger and I both try to add a dash of novelty into our repeated holidays and familiar routines.\nWhen I visit England, which I try do a few times a year, it's not for carbon copy experiences but for new-to-me football grounds, theatre productions and hiking trails. If I only stayed in Wandsworth and saw matches at Craven Cottage, my holidays would get dull quickly. Instead, I traverse the country, eat in different restaurants and allow my curiosity to guide me to new adventures. According to Russell, this blend helps keep the spark for exploration alive while still providing comfort. This is important because she says, because \"there's a point at which revisiting the same place starts to become problematic. If we return to a place too many times and exceed our 'appetite' for it, it's called hedonic adaptation – acclimatising to pleasurable things and reverting to our original baseline emotionally.\"\nMore like this:\n• Why 'best time to visit' no longer applies\n• Is it time to retire the all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet?\n• The perils of letting AI plan your next trip\nTiger makes a similar case for her Greek predilection. \"The country remains new to me – new beaches, islands and rural towns – so many places to explore that I could spend a lifetime there and not get to even a fraction of them.\" Judged solely on arrival airport codes, our trips may appear like duplicates. Yet the experiences we're having – Tiger in Greece and me in England – are different enough that our journeys never feel stale.\nGrowing up in the Philadelphia suburbs, I watched neighbours travel en masse and in traffic to the Jersey Shore every summer. They'd go to the same town, the same beach with the same amusements on the same pier and stay in the same rental homes. I once wondered: what happens when travel becomes not a break from routine, but just another routine itself?\nNow, in an ever-stressful world, I see the appeal of seeking out joy in the familiar while still stepping ever so slightly out of my comfort zone to find new thrills in old places.\nTiger loves her Greek holiday routines but admits that other parts of the world appeal to her too. \"I am very curious about Japan, but I really like to control the rhythm of my days,\" she says. Her work as a professor is tiring, as is her commute, so it's understandable when she says, \"My time in Greece is a respite that I welcome, both because it's familiar and strange at the same time.\"\nShe adds: \"Athens almost feels like a second home.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram ."

      "title": "How convenience store socks became Japan's coolest souvenir",
      "link": "https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20251209-how-convenience-store-socks-became-japans-coolest-souvenir",
      "content": "A simple pair of striped socks from Japanese convenience stores has become a global cult item. But how did an everyday essential turn into the souvenir travellers seek out?\nI am on the hunt in Tokyo. But instead of seeking out a steaming bowl of ramen or a neon-lit street corner, I'm prowling convenience stores for seasonally available socks.\nSomehow, an everyday essential has become one of Japan's unlikeliest cult souvenirs, drawing expats, travellers and TikTok creators alike. Sold for as little as ¥390 (about £2), these \"conbini socks\" now top shopping lists, spark social-media challenges and even inspire full clothing lines. And like so many other visitors, I'll be leaving with a suitcase full.\nPerhaps it was only a matter of time before convenience stores, or conbini as they're affectionately known in Japan, became fashion hubs. While in much of the world convenience stores are places to grab a greasy snack, in Japan they've evolved into a one-stop-everything shop. The reputation began in the 1970s when more women entering the workforce meant a rising demand for easy-to-eat dinner options, and was solidified as additional services were added, like the ability to buy concert tickets, pay bills or even just the opportunity to use clean bathroom or free wi-fi.\nSo when national conbini chain FamilyMart launched their Convenience Wear line in 2021, with socks, bags and underwear, locals barely blinked. One item, however, immediately stood out: \"Line Socks\", calf-height white tennis-style socks featuring two blue and green stripes modelled after the FamilyMart store logo.  The socks became so popular that FamilyMart opened Famima!, a small clothing-and-lifestyle shop inside Tokyo's Blue Front Shibaura building – where there's also a regular FamilyMart a few steps away.\nBut FamilyMart isn't alone in the convenience-store sock market. Rival conbini chain Lawson partnered with Japanese designer Muji in 2021 to release two striped styles: a pink and blue pair that mimics the Lawson sign; and a navy-and-white pair inspired by store worker uniforms. During this year's Osaka expo, 7-Eleven sold limited-edition orange, green and red striped socks made from \"Ovoveil\", an upcycled eggshell membrane.\nThe streetwear trend is strong in Japan, and wearing socks convenience store socks has the same energy as a Supreme t-shirt or A Bathing Ape hoodie, albeit at a far more impulse-friendly price point.\nThe Line Sock's rise to cult status began during Japan's post-Covid border restrictions, when they became an unexpected hit with expats. J-Fashion designer Mikan Mandarin , founder of Vina of the Valley, found herself unexpectedly swept up by the trend, even though it didn't match her kawaii (cute) style.\n\"It was one of those things that anyone could wear,\" she said. \"And I think that's why it had the appeal that it did. The world was closed off, so it felt nice to have a little sense of community.\nThe iconography soon seeped into internet culture, topping local bloggers' Japan shopping lists, and, for American vloggers in Japan Megan and Ben – aka Hito Bito – creating a fun universal talking point. They describe buying FamilyMart socks as a \"a rite of passage\" for most expats in the country – and the sock even inspired them to create a social media video where they challenged themselves to create an entire outfit sourced from FamilyMart.\n\"They're kind of iconic in the same way carrying around a blue Ikea bag as a purse is,\" they said. \"If you get a well-stocked convenience store you can find plenty of good options.\"\nWhen Japan's borders reopened in October 2022 and visitor numbers quickly began to surpass pre-pandemic levels, travellers quickly adopted the socks as must buys. Long-standing fascination with Japan's convenience stores meant many visitors were drawn to the idea of taking home a small souvenir, and the product fell in line with Japan's tradition of affordable, everyday design objects – think well-made chopsticks, cotton yukata or anything Muji.\nAnd in a nation where shopping culture thrives and shops like Don Quijote and Bic Camera do brisk business in suitcases for those who have over-shopped, socks became an easily packable addition to the traveller's haul, offering a slice of modern Japanese iconography at a budget-friendly price.\nThat's why Reginal Hakizimana, founder and managing director of Enclose Africa Safaris brought home multiple pairs home from a trip to Japan, both for friends and himself.\n\"FamilyMart and Lawson's socks remind me of specific cultural aspects of Japan,\" he said. \"These aren't just goods that say 'Made in Japan'; rather, they're part of the everyday items within reach at convenience stores, and that establishes their realness. They are compact, lightweight, inexpensive, practical and best of all, they bring back memories. They encapsulate the warmth, thoughtfulness and creativity of Japan.\"\nIt made sense that variations on the \"Line Sock\" theme would soon follow. Anyone who has developed a fondness for a seasonal snack knows the speed with which FamilyMart rotates their limited-edition products – and the same logic has shaped its sock collection.\nThe chain now releases both calf- and ankle-length designs in seasonal colour palettes, plus one-off collaborations with major pop-culture franchises, including Stranger Things, The Simpsons and the Fuji Rock Festival. Nippon League baseball teams Hiroshima Carps, Yomiuri Giants and Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks have also received regionally available Line Sock editions, as did FamilyMart's signature fried chicken, Famichiki.\n\"Emphasis is placed on either 'global brands' or 'local community focus',\" said Kaori Iori, Public Relations FamilyMart Co Ltd. \"Such partnerships generate substantial buzz and serve as an opportunity to attract new fans to Convenience Wear.\"\nMore like this:\n• The unique culture of Japanese convenience stores\n• How sleeping in old schools is reviving rural Japan\n• Who drank all the matcha? How tourism drained a Japanese town\nAmong Japanese consumers, conbini socks remain a practical item: something you buy because you forgot a spare, or because a limited-edition collaboration catches your eye. Yet FamilyMart's sock sales have now exceeded 30 million pairs, finding fans across the globe. Yunna Takeuchi, co-founder of City Unscripted, grew up in the UK with a deep understanding of Japanese language and culture. On her first visit to Japan, she noticed that the socks felt aligned with the culture she had experienced at home.\n\"Sold in convenience stores, these socks tell you one thing about the nature of Japanese design: it combines utility and elegance in a single piece,\" she explains. \"So, what I did was take one drawer of these socks per season in order to distribute them to friends who are interested in Japanese culture.\"\nAs Convenience Wear continues to expand its collaborations, the Line Sock shows no sign of losing its grip on travellers' imaginations. Visitors are seeking a sense of life in the country, and memories of the small moments of travel. In that way, what could be more fitting than a humble pair of socks?\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram ."

      "title": "Bhutan's long-secluded 'hidden paradise'",
      "link": "https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20251126-bhutans-long-secluded-hidden-paradise",
      "content": "Bhutan only opened to the outside world in 1974. Yet, one region remained closed for decades afterwards, and is one of the Himalayas' best-kept secrets.\nIt's 05:00 and 100 people have gathered in the courtyard of Lhakhang Karpo, a 7th-Century monastery at the base of three sacred mountains in Bhutan's secluded Haa Valley.\nIncense plumes swirl in the mist. Pink rice porridge with Sichuan pepper steams in vats. Low, thrumming chants hum through me. Then: drums. A blast of dungchen trumpets. Crackling, cawing victory calls and – pow!\nI jump.\nA gunshot.\n\"It's only a blank,\" Rinchen Khandu, the town mayor, assures me.\nThis isn't your typical Buddhist festival. I'm at the Ap Chundu Lhapsoel , a 10km procession held every 1 November in honour of the valley's warrior deity who helped locals defeat invading Tibetans in the 17th Century. It's the nation's longest chipdrel (ceremonial procession) – and the only one where tourists are welcomed – yet few visitors have ever heard of it. In a way, the festival is a metaphor for Haa itself.\nLocated along Bhutan's rugged western frontier near the Tibetan border, Haa is one of the smallest and most secluded districts in the world's last Buddhist kingdom – and one of the Himalayas' best-kept secrets.\nBhutan remained isolated from the outside world for centuries to protect its culture, only allowing foreign tourists in 1974. But Haa – because of its sensitive position along the Tibetan border and its use as a military training ground for the Royal Bhutan Army until the mid-1990s – remained closed for decades longer, opening only in 2002. For years, it was a hermit region within a hermit kingdom.\nToday, the diminuitive district is one of Bhutan's most biodiverse corners, home to rolling emerald mountains where pine forests spill down the slopes. Blue sheep drink from glacial lakes, red pandas hide in bamboo undergrowth, snow leopards roam the ridgelines and blue poppies (Bhutan's national flower) bloom in the higher elevations come summer.\nBecause of its long isolation, Haa is also where Bhutan's Indigenous Bon traditions remain strongest and its culture is still shaped by guardian deities. Unlike other parts of the country that now have Western hotel brands, Haa has just a handful of homestays, heritage inns and local eateries. As a result, the valley is a veritable time capsule, offering a glimpse of Bhutan before it opened up.\nHow to visit Haa Valley\nVisa: All tourists are required to have a visa (£30/$40) and pay a daily Sustainable Development Fee (£75/$100) to help the government fund free healthcare and education.\nWhen to visit: Spring for the Haa Spring Festival , summer for the warm weather, autumn for festivals (Haa Tshechu, Ap Chundu Lhapsoel) and winter for Haa's New Year, typically in December.\nHow to get there: Fly to Paro and drive to Haa via the Chelela Pass or from Thimphu via the recently upgraded Chuzzom-Haa highway.\nHow to visit: You'll need a car and driver and should hire local guides for day hikes.\nWhere to stay? Experience village life at Ugyen's (Haa's oldest homestay), set in a 200-year-old farmhouse with hot stone baths, or opt for added comforts at Soednam Zhingkha Lodge or Lechuna Lodge nearby in Hatey. Newer options include Haa Valley Camp, Katsho Eco Camp (opening in spring 2026) and Sangwa Camp.\nEtiquette: Dress modestly and wear a kira or gho (Bhutan's national dress) if attending a festival or visiting a temple/dzong.\nHelpful websites: The Department of Tourism is the authority on all things tourism, while Druk Air or Bhutan Airlines are good resources for flights.\nMost visitors to Bhutan fly into the nation's lone international airport in Paro and beeline to the world-famous Taktsang temple, the cliff-side monastery perched at 3,120m (10,236ft). They may then head east to the capital city Thimphu; the town of Punakha, home to the country's most beautiful fortress ; and the alpine Phobjikha Valley, where elegant black-necked cranes overwinter before returning to Tibet.\nYet, despite Haa being located just 67km (42 miles) west of Paro, only 2% of tourists ever make the two-hour drive to reach it, according to the Department of Tourism. That's largely because the route crosses the Chelela Pass (3,988m, 13,084ft), the country's highest drivable road, which – on a clear day – offers sweeping mountain views across to the Indian state of Sikkim and the Tibetan plateau.\nYet, those who make the zigzagging journey will find Juneydrak hermitage , a gravity-defying temple rivalling the tourist-thronged Taktsang that hovers some 2,930m (9,612ft) above the valley. There is also a collection of world-class hikes, such as the five-day Nub-Tshonapata trek, which traces an ancient trade route through glacial lakes and high passes; and the three-day Sagala Trek that follows a historic route used by rice planters connecting Haa and Paro. For those on a tighter timeline, the 27km (16 mile) Meri Puensum trail, which overlooks yak-studded valleys, has recently been widened to accommodate mountain bikers as well as hikers.\nOver the last decade, a homestay network has also formed, allowing travellers to stay with local Haa families and experience village life – from tasting the region's decadent fondue-like philu cheese to learning to make hoentey (29-ingredient buckwheat dumplings).\n\"[Haa] has its own charm due to its remoteness and thin population [just 13,600 people across 2,000 sq km],\" says Phintso Ongdi, who owns Lechuna Heritage Lodge , a 100-year-old home he converted into a seven-room lodge. Thanks to limited development, Ongdi says, \"Haa's traditions and way of life will remain suspended in time for some years to come, and that's what many visitors, and people like myself, value and want to experience.\"\nThe day after the Ap Chundu procession, I set out on the 11km (7 mile) Haa Panorama Trail , a pandemic initiative that connects four monasteries and reveals wide views of the valley and nearby Meri Puenseum mountains, whose three peaks tower over the Lhakhang Kharpo below. The trail also intersects with the start of the 400km (248 mile) Trans Bhutan Trail near Juneydrak Hermitage, where nuns undertake three-year silent meditation retreats.\nThat evening, I soaked my tired legs in a traditional hot-stone bath at Soednam Zingkha Heritage 's serene bathhouse. Freshly picked artemisa, rose petals and dried calamus floated in the medicinal herb-infused water, and latticed doors provided an onsen-like atmosophere, beckoning me slip into the river below to cool off.\n\"Haa is a hidden paradise within another hidden paradise – Bhutan – where myths, legends and nature are all intertwined,\" the nation's Prime Minister, Tshering Tobgay, who hails from southern Haa, later told me.\nHaa Governor Melam Zangpo has also announced plans for a 5km (3 miles) Tergola Red Panda Trail through old-growth rhodhodendron forest in southern Haa, which will take visitors deep into the heart of the elusive animals' habitat when it opens in 2027. (Haa has the most red pandas in Bhutan: 42.)\nThe evening after joining the Ap Chundu procession, I found myself outside Haa's Jigme Khesar Strict Nature Reserve . I was guest at the Sangwa Camp , a roving luxury camp that moves through Bhutan's lesser-visited valleys, helping rural communities keep their fragile traditions alive. After settling into my cosy yak-wool tent (handcrafted by Bhutan's semi-nomadic Layap people), I ventured out into a clearing in the forest where five dancers wearing rig-na headdresses were singing a haunting, ancient song in honour of the valley's guardian deity, Ap Chundu, around a bonfire.\nMore like this:\n• The island reached by walking on the ocean floor\n• Costa Rica's rainforest reborn by butterflies\n• The epic road trip where the road runs out\nWhen the dancers departed, their melodies dissolving into the cooling air, I stayed beside the bonfire. The Moon rose above the silouhette of the mountains. I was alone, but Ap Chundu felt ever-present, standing guard over Bhutan's most secluded region, just as he always has.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram ."
