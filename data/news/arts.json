      "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd5mpv61deo",
      "content": "A community theatre set up for adults with learning disabilities and autism says it is at risk of excluding patrons if it cannot upgrade its facilities to meet the access needs of older residents.\nThe Chrysalis Theatre in Milton Keynes is run by the charity Camphill, which has provided homes, work and community activities for its residents since 1981.\nBut the space is no longer suited to the physical disabilities which its residents now face as they age, including wheelchair access.\nLucy Davies, development manager at Camphill, said the community \"lives, works, plays and celebrates together\".\nShe added: \"Residents get involved in creative workshops during the day and live together on site.\n\"Living at Camphill is about having a real purpose in life and meaningful activity.\"\nMany of the 80 residents have lived there for more than 40 years.\nThe Chrysalis Theatre opened 20 years ago and welcomes hundreds of people with learning disabilities each year to its concerts, workshops, and theatre shows.\nIt runs daily theatre workshops, and on Sundays two church groups hire the building, which covers the running costs.\nBut the counters in the foyer are at standing height and the stage is accessed by steps, so the charity wants to raise enough funds to provide a more accessible theatre.\nIt launched a Big Give Christmas Challenge campaign to pay for the work, and to install cameras so that some productions can be live-streamed to make it more inclusive.\nMs Davies added: \"There is now better medical care and a better awareness of how to support people with disabilities so lifespans are being extended.\n\"And as people age, they get age-related illnesses such as dementia, sight loss and a loss of mobility. This affects everybody.\"\nThe charity recently appointed a new theatre manager, Chris Bradley, who has been inspired by how the residents value the space.\n\"My long-term vision is to bring more inclusive shows to the theatre, .. programming that reflects our charity's values and creates more opportunities for our residents,\" Mr Bradley said.\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds , Facebook , Instagram and X ."

      "content": "A hospice patient has had his wish come true as a set of his watercolours, previously hidden away in a cupboard, have gone on display.\nFor ten years Dick Scott's paintings, inspired by Francisco de Zurbarán's 17th-century portraits Jacob and his Twelve Sons, have been tucked away at his Longbenton home in North Tyneside.\nNow the 13 paintings are being viewed by the public for the very first time at Bishop Auckland's Artists' Hub.\nMr Scott, 86, who is receiving palliative care at St Oswald's Hospice in Gosforth, said: \"All I've ever wanted is for people to see my paintings.\"\nHe added: \"For them to make their debut in such a prestigious setting is beyond my imagination.\"\nSpeaking about his influences, he explained: \"I'm not a religious man, but there was something about those paintings that really moved me.\n\"It took about two days to paint each one. I did one and thought 'that doesn't look that bad' and I put it under the cupboard.\"\nIt was not until a conversation between social worker Marisa Woodward and his sister Sue Coxon that Mr Scott's paintings were discovered.\nMrs Woodward then contacted The Auckland Project - a regeneration charity working to establish Bishop Auckland as a cultural destination - for advice on how to display them.\nRichard Hinch, chief operating officer at the Auckland Project, asked for the paintings to go on display for the first exhibition in the new Artists' Hub.\n\"When I told Dick, he was overwhelmed with emotion, he never thought anyone would see them,\" Mrs Coxon said.\nMr Hinch added: \"The fact that Dick has done these over 20 years ago and they have been locked in a cupboard, there' something quite special about that.\n\"These are done as watercolours and he has done them just from looking at a picture in a magazine and that's quite incredible.\"\nMr Scott first tried painting in 2000 during his recovery from a liver transplant.\nIn 2012, after reading about the original artworks being saved and the creation of what is now The Auckland Project, he was inspired to emulate Zurbarán's series.\nMr Scott's pieces will be on display for a month before they are donated to St Oswald's Hospice.\nFor his next project he hopes to create a mural to celebrate hospice care.\nFollow BBC North East on X , Facebook , Nextdoor and Instagram ."

      "content": "The new owner of a theatre hall, which was previously declared as a \"surplus\" by Kent County Council, has been named.\nMichael Wheatley-Ward, founder and director of Sarah Thorne Theatre, is the new owner of Broadstairs Memorial Hall.\nThe building was listed with a £350,000 guide price but received a single bid, £45,000 below its asking price.\nSarah Thorne Theatre, of which Dame Judi Dench is a patron, has a five-year peppercorn lease at the hall .\nMr Wheatley-Ward said he had several reasons why he thought to save the Sarah Thorne Theatre site.\n\"Community theatre plays an important part in life and especially now where we need places for people to be bad at, learn and develop their skills,\" he said.\n\"It offers employment and a purpose to get up in the morning. Like our Patron Judi Dench says, retirement is not a word in our dictionary.\"\nHe added they are forming a charity trust and would pass over the theatre to hold for future generations.\n\"Plans are now being set to raise funds to finalise both the purchase of the site and improvements to the building. Details of these will be released shortly,\" he added.\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook , on X , and on Instagram . Send your story ideas to southeasttoday@bbc.co.uk or WhatsApp us on 08081 002250."

      "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czj0g9n8j24o",
      "content": "Councillors have said they feel \"hoodwinked\" over the proposed demolition of a town centre theatre which shut in April.\nIn October, Cannock Chase District Council's planning committee approved for the Forum Shopping Centre in Cannock to be knocked down as part of regeneration plans.\nThe officers clarified at the time the neighbouring Prince of Wales Theatre would be excluded from the scheme, adding a condition to strengthen its position.\nBut cabinet members agreed at a meeting on 4 December to the inclusion of the venue, \"within the red line for the regeneration programme with the intention to demolish, subject to planning consent\".\nOn Tuesday, members of the council's economic prosperity scrutiny committee called for the cabinet's decision to be referred back.\nCouncillor Darrell Mawle, who put forward a motion, said \"it came as quite a shock\" and said members did not have enough evidence \"to justify this course of action\".\n\"There has been no clear social economic impact assessment to inform the decision to demolish it. There has not been a diligent process to explore alternative options for ongoing operation of the theatre,\" he added.\nFellow scrutiny committee member Samantha Thompson, who is also on the planning committee, said: \"There was a lot of hope for the Prince of Wales Theatre and I felt we have been conned.\n\"We were given a condition that the Prince of Wales would be protected and it's as if people were saying what we wanted to hear. I find it very disappointing, I feel we have been let down and I feel we were a bit hoodwinked on that.\"\nThe 427-seat venue shut as part of cost-saving measures to address a £1.3m council budget shortfall.\nIn September the cabinet voted against transferring it to the Cannock Chase Theatre Trust (CCTT), despite a campaign from local residents.\nAt the time the shopping centre application was submitted, the decision to not proceed with the theatre's transfer as a community asset to CCTT had not yet been made, scrutiny members heard.\nThis news was gathered by the Local Democracy Reporting Service which covers councils and other public service organisations.\nFollow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on Facebook , X and Instagram ."

      "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62v0zdqkezo",
      "content": "Giant sketches of an angel, used by artist John Hutton to create one of Coventry Cathedral's most striking features, have been repaired and gifted to the cathedral.\nChalk drawings were created on black paper by the engraver as a blueprint for each of the 66 angel and saint figures he took a decade to carve into the 70ft (21m) high glass West Screen.\nIn 2022, the Friends of Coventry Cathedral group bought the three sketches, which have now been restored in Gloucestershire.\nThe tryptic will be on display at the cathedral over the Christmas period.\nThe Friends group initially raised £1,500 to purchase the art, which had been in the possession of one of Hutton's friends.\nAbout £20,000 has also been spent on specialist restoration and framing.\nCathedral archivist Dianne Morris, said she was \"so excited\" to see the finished art.\n\"It's all my Christmases come at once\", she said.\n\"When they were offered to us for sale I knew we had to get involved.\n\"They're so magnificent, I think I would have bought them myself anyway.\"\nSpecialist conservator Heather Norville-Day, from Wickwar, said she was \"thrilled\" to be asked to carry out the restoration work.\n\"I can't tell you how honoured I am to do this.\"\nThe prints were \"extremely brittle, they were water damaged, they had mould damage, a lot of fractures and missing areas,\" she explained.\n\"Over the last 50 years, pieces have dropped off and been lost.\"\nShe has worked on the sketches for about six months, and she said they would now \"last for 100 years or more\".\nBut, she added, it had been a \"challenge from start to finish\".\n\"I can't tell you how easily they could have been destroyed, I'm surprised they survived.\"\nThe sketches consist of three 7ft by 3ft (2.1m by 1m) images which together make up a tryptic of one of the flying angels depicted on the glass screen.\nThey were created as the engraver worked on the screen, which was completed in time for the cathedral's 1962 consecration.\nIt's thought Hutton's life was cut short by inhaling quantities of glass dust.\nHis ashes are interred at the base of the screen.\nThe carvings were created \"using an outline sketch of each of the figures\" said Ms Morris, \"and then the detail was created by a tool that he invented himself\", comprising hand and dentist drills.\nHutton's wife Marigold acted as his model for the figures , she said.\n\"To be able to get an outline of the figures, John draped her in an old bedspread while he quickly sketched the outline of the saints and angels.\"\nThe cathedral owns a smaller Hutton sketch, and was gifted another, by the artist's granddaughter, of an angel - a work destroyed during a robbery .\nThe exhibition marked the \"end of a two year project to bring back to the cathedral a design that will be here forever, we hope,\" said Martin Williams, the outgoing chair of the Friends.\n\"It's such an exciting moment to welcome them back,\" he said.\n\"It has been conserved and framed to museum standards so that it can tell its story to future generations\".\nThe artist's work can also be seen at Guildford Cathedral and at cathedrals in New Zealand, where Hutton was born.\nHowever, Mr Williams insists Coventry's are the best.\n\"The angels aren't just there being holy and pious,\" he said.\n\"He's depicted them as dancing and playing instruments and flying with movement.\"\nAaron Law, one of those who helped raise money for the initial purchase, said the sketches allowed visitors to the cathedral to \"see the different stages of the process to create the glass, and the effort involved\".\n\"It's really good to see them, almost at home,\" he added.\nFollow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire on BBC Sounds , Facebook , X and Instagram ."

      "content": "The three finalists for this year's Strictly Come Dancing have been confirmed, after one couple was eliminated from the competition in Sunday night's results show.\nIn the bottom two this week were EastEnders actor Balvinder Sopal and her partner Julian Caillon - for a record sixth time this series - and reality TV star Amber Davies and her partner Nikita Kuzmin.\nAfter a dance-off, the judges voted to send Sopal home.\nDavies, who survived the dance-off for the second week running, will join social media star George Clarke and former England footballer Karen Carney in next week's final.\nThe EastEnders star, who performed a Salsa and a Waltz as her two semi-final dances, said she had \"absolutely adored every single minute\".\nSpeaking on Sunday night's results show after her elimination, Sopal said: \"All the dance-offs, all the challenges, but just more than anything, just being in this building and dancing on this floor with such an amazing human being.\n\"It was my 'Yes Year', and I said yes to Strictly. My family, we've had some hard times, but they've been here.\"\nShe also paid tribute to her dance partner Caillon, saying: \"You've been brilliant in every sense of the word.\n\"When I wobbled, and when I felt really brilliant about the dance and got the steps right, you've just held me in your hands and you've gone, 'Bal, we've got this.'\n\"I've never felt alone on this floor, and I just want you to remember me. Don't replace me too soon!\"\nCaillon said Sopal \"embodies\" what Strictly Come Dancing is about.\n\"Her spirit is unbreakable, and you have shown me that I'm actually dreaming too small, and Bal can inspire us that whatever any of us want in life, all you have to have is the desire to go after it.\"\nThe celebrities performed two dances each on Saturday.\nCarney and her partner Carlos Gu topped the leader board for their performance, after receiving a near perfect score of 78 out of a possible 80.\nThe results show also featured a surprise for departing presenters Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman.\nFollowing a highlights package of their best moments working on the show, the pair were each awarded their own unique golden Glitterball Trophy.\nThere was also a festive performance from Kylie Minogue of her new single XMAS accompanied by 16 Strictly professional dancers, plus a special performance of the 90s classic Sit Down from the band James.\nThe remaining three couples will perform during next weekend's final.\nIt will air on BBC One and BBC iPlayer at 19:00 GMT on Saturday 20 December, with the winner crowned that evening."

      "content": "Parts of Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos, have been turned into an \"open-air gallery\", in the words of the organisers of the city's first street art festival.\nOne of the featured artists, Ashaolu Oluwafemi, told the BBC that the festival brings art \"to the people and the community\".\n\"People don't always have the opportunity to go to exhibitions, so they don't have the opportunity to see art,\" he said.\nThe artwork is on display on Ozumba Mbadiwe Avenue, a busy street in Victoria Island in the heart of the city.\nOluwafemi, who was born and brought up in Lagos, said he and the other artists were telling the story of the city and its rise.\n\"You have to be wise and strong and brilliant to make it out of Lagos.\"\nAlthough Lagos is known for its vibrant arts scene, nightlife and creativity, street art is relatively unknown.\n\"The visibility is not too strong compared to other African nations,\" painter Ernest Ibe told AFP news agency.\n\"So, it's a challenge, but the country is evolving. We are beginning to understand the impact of social murals and how it affects us socially and in our environment in general.\"\nThis painting was done by Babalola Oluwafemi (no relation), a Nigerian artist who flew in from the British city of Manchester.\n\"I'm just telling how Lagos people love to party, love to go to parties, love to eat food. And they just love to be colourful,\" she told AFP.\nThe peacock is often used to symbolise beauty and pride in Nigerian art, AFP reports.\n\"Everything in Lagos is different. A whole lot of cars, a whole lot of traffic - a whole lot of comments from people passing by [saying] 'Nice work',\" said the 32-year-old.\n\"Lagos is a place where you can express yourself,\" Ashaolu Oluwafemi told the BBC.\nHe said he painted the mural above to show the joy of the city.\n\"This woman is expressing herself. She's so excited about her life in Lagos.\"\nHe said that people were very happy to see the street art. \"It really speaks to them.\"\nThe festival opened on Wednesday and continues until Monday, 15 December but the murals will be left in place afterwards.\nMost of the artists are Nigerian but Ottograph travelled from the Dutch city of Amsterdam to paint his mural.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica"

      "content": "A bootcamp to help artists get their careers off the ground has seen participants get their work into galleries and magazines.\nThe 10-week programme to help working class artists in the West Midlands has run twice this year and was developed by Birmingham-based art curator and critic Ruth Millington.\nShe said the art world was notoriously hard to get into, \"particularly those without connections or inherited wealth\".\nSandra Palmer, known as The Brummy Artist, who has shown her work in exhibitions in Birmingham and London, said the programme was a \"game-changer\".\nSix artists from the first bootcamp have gone on to show their work in galleries and all 20 have had press coverage, including in the magazine Stylist.\nThe programme, Get Gallery Ready , funded by West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA) and based at Solihull College & University Centre, is free for visual artists in the region.\nGuest speakers were brought in, Ms Millington reviewed each person's portfolio, and the groups had behind-the-scenes visits to galleries, museums and studios, including Ikon Gallery , RBSA Gallery , Coventry Biennial , Stryx Gallery and Nook .\nEvery bootcamp ends in an exhibition at The Courtyard Gallery at The Core in Solihull.\nBirmingham-based painter Tara Harris said her confidence, belief and motivation to be seen as an artist received \"a massive boost\".\nYulia Lisle, originally from Ukraine, went on to secure her first solo exhibition, A Moment to Gather, at Nook gallery. She said the support \"changed everything\".\nOne of those taking part, Odette Campbell, works in textiles and creates abstract embroidery .\nShe said taking part had given her \"extra belief that stitch does have a place in the art world\".\nMs Campbell is running a six-week craft club on Tuesdays at Wolverhampton Art Gallery next year.\nArtists in the second bootcamp are currently showing their work in the exhibition Winter Folk , which runs until 10 January at The Courtyard Gallery.\nMs Millington, who previously worked for galleries in London, said the art world was fiercely competitive and difficult to navigate, and art school did not tend to teach artists how to prepare for galleries.\n\"I wanted to level up the playing field,\" she said.\nAt WMCA, Hayley Pepler said the authority had been \"thrilled by the phenomenal success\" and how the bootcamps had responded directly to local needs.\nFollow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds , Facebook , X and Instagram ."

      "title": "'Anyone can do it' - Turner Prize winner's inspirational effect",
      "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qeeqn08n5o",
      "content": "It is the morning after Nnena Kalu won the Turner Prize and excitement is in the air at an unassuming studio in Glasgow's Trongate.\nProject Ability is a charity based at the studio that supports artists of all abilities - and their number previously included Kalu, who on Tuesday became the first learning disabled artist to land the Turner Prize .\nNow other artists who use the studio are looking at her success and feeling inspired by it.\nKendal, an 18-year-old who specialises in large canvas paintings of mountains, told BBC Scotland News Kalu's victory showed \"anyone can be an artist - it doesn't matter what they have.\"\nNnena Kalu is autistic and has limited verbal communication, but to those at Project Ability the deeply expressive art she creates on the canvas and in sculpture has sent a clear message - learning disabilities are no barrier to success.\nThe 59-year-old was born in Glasgow but moved to England when she was a child. However, her roots in the city came to the fore in 2018 when she was invited to stage her first solo exhibition at the Glasgow International art festival.\nThe studio that hosted her was Project Ability.\nElisabeth Gibson, the charity's executive artistic director, described the first time she observed Kalu creating her works as \"mesmerising\".\nShe said: \"It's uniquely Nnena. Her action, the sound that she makes with the chalk on the paper, everything about it was really captivating.\"\nKalu's work uses brightly coloured sculptures , haphazardly wrapped in layers of ribbon, string, card and shiny VHS tape, and drawings of swirling, tornado-like shapes.\nMs Gibson believes the gallery takeover in 2018 was a hugely significant step for the artist.\n\"This was her first solo exhibition and it's a really important festival for the city. Lots of curators come, lots of artists come and it gave her work really high visibility and other opportunities fell on after that.\"\nNow others at the Trongate studio are feeling inspired as a result.\nAndrew, 50, a fellow learning disabled artist said the win was \"inspiring\".\n\"Good for her. I've got learning difficulties as well, and I've also got Down's. And I think that's amazing what one person can do. There's also one on Strictly Come Dancing. She was an amazing dancer. I think good for them.\"\nKendal described Kalu's success as \"pretty amazing.\"\nHe added:  \"It's a very great achievement for her and it shows that no matter what, anyone can go through with achieving goals. Anyone can be an artist. It doesn't matter what they have or if they're struggling.\"\nMs Gibson was watching on TV when Kalu was announced as the winner on Tuesday night.\n\"We were absolutely thrilled, absolutely delighted,\" she said. \"She deserved it. She's honestly such a hard-working artist.\n\"It means a huge amount. People maybe didn't take work by learning disabled artists as seriously as they might have artists in a different context.\n\"I think it will mean people may be more open to it and not be so judgmental.\"\nHer work was praised by judges at the Turner Prize, who said she created \"really compelling sculptures and drawings that could only be made by Nnena.\"\nJury chairman  and Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson said her drawings had \"a beautiful intricacy to them\" and \"look like swirling vortexes.\"\nCharlotte Hollinshead, who has worked with Kalu for 25 years, said on stage at the ceremony that the win was seismic and had \"broken a very stubborn glass ceiling.\"\nNot everyone felt the same way.\nWaldemar Januszcack, the chief art critic for the Sunday Times, described Kalu's work as \"up there with the worst art I have seen at the Turner\" and accused judges of \"virtue signalling\".\nGibson responded: \"It's just so narrow-minded but it's to be expected. The Turner Prize is always criticised.\n\"It's almost part of its job to invite controversy, discussion and debate.\"\nWhile opinions on the work vary, those at Project Ability are simply getting on with helping artists like Nnena Kalu, Andrew and Kendal fulfil their potential.\nIn Andrew's case, that includes a new goal.\nAsked if he could win the Turner Prize next, he replied: \"I can do it. Anyone can do it.\""
